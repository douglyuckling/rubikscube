# 3D Rubik's Cube #

I started this little project as an experiment for learning [WebGL]. I'm
currently using [three.js], but that may change if I decide to check out other
frameworks.

Currently you can't actually turn the individual faces of the cube, which makes
it pretty boring. I hope to add that soon.
